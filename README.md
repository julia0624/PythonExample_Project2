Scientific Question: Which stage of breast cancer would more likely have an overexpressed level of TP53?  

You will need two files to run the code.

1) The jupyter notebook
2) The csv file that was used was obtained from an Excel sheet from the paper "Integrated RNA and DNA sequencing reveals early drivers of metastatic breast cancer" (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5873890/#sd).
  - I chose specific TP53 expression data from the Excel sheet, made my own Excel with transferred data, and turned that into an csv file.
